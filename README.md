# Task-Manager-ToDos

Using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) is a popular choice for this kind of application because it uses JavaScript both on the client and server side, simplifying the development process. Let's break down the steps to create a simple ToDo application.

**Step 1:** **Setting Up Your Development Environment**
Install Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. npm comes with Node.js, so installing Node.js should suffice.
MongoDB: You can either install MongoDB locally or set up a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas, which provides a free tier for small applications.
Code Editor: Use any code editor or IDE you're comfortable with. Visual Studio Code is a popular option offering great support for JavaScript and Node.js.

****Step 2:** Initialize Your Project**
1.Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:
     mkdir todo-mern-app
     cd todo-mern-app
2.Initialize a new Node.js project:
     npm init -y
3.Install Express.js:
    npm install express
4.Create your server file:
   touch server.js

****Step 3:** Set Up the Backend**
1.Build your server using Express.js in server.js
2.Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose:
   npm install mongoose
3.Define a ToDo model:
  Create a new file for your model, e.g., Todo.js
4.Create CRUD API endpoints:
  Implement CRUD operations in server.js or ideally in separate route handlers. For example, to read all todos

**Step 4: Set Up the Frontend**
1.Create a React app:
   Navigate back to your project root and use Create React App  
2.Navigate into your React app folder and start it to ensure everything works
3.Install Axios for making HTTP requests
   npm install axios
4.Create your components:
  Inside your client/src directory, create components for displaying and adding todos. Use useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and side effects, such as fetching todos from the backend.

**Step 5: Connect Frontend with Backend**
1.Proxy setup: In your client/package.json, add a proxy to delegate requests to your Express backend during development:
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
2.Fetch todos in your React app using Axios and display them. You'll use the useEffect hook to fetch todos when the component mounts.
3.Create functionality to add todos: Implement a form in React and use Axios to post a new todo to your backend.

**Step 6: Running Your Application**
1.Start your backend server (if it's not already running):
  node server.js
2.Start your React app (from the client directory):
   npm start

Now, you should have a basic ToDo application running with the MERN stack. You can add features such as updating and deleting todos, user authentication, and styling your application to improve its appearance and functionality.
